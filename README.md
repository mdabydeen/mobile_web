MOBILE WEB BASED APP. DEVELOPMENT FINAL PROJECT
===============================

This repository contains the final project for <a href="http://sheridancollege.ca/Programs%20and%20Courses/Full-Time%20Programs/Programs%20A-Z%20Index/Computer%20Systems%20Technology%20-%20Software%20Development%20and%20Network%20Engineering%20Co-op.aspx" target="_blank">SYST 35288 : Mobile Web Based Application Development</a> course which is part of the <a href="http://sheridancollege.ca/Programs%20and%20Courses/Full-Time%20Programs/Programs%20A-Z%20Index/Computer%20Systems%20Technology%20-%20Software%20Development%20and%20Network%20Engineering%20Co-op.aspx">Computer Systems Technology: Software Development and 
Network Engineering Coop Program</a>, offered at <a href="http://sheridancollege.ca" target="_blank">Sheridan College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning</a>.

This project was done by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/firelinks" target="_blank"> Michael Dabydeen</a> & <a href="http://www.twitter.com/firelinks" target="_blank">Daniel Audino</a>. It was submitted on August 9th 2012, graded at 100% and considered the best attempt of the class. 

Below is a description of the objectives that we set out to achieve. Please note that while real data was used in this project, the result was merely fictional and used only for learning purposes. 

================================
##OECD Data Explorer and Visualizer
================================

This project is a group project intended to exercise a student's skill in major web technologies focused on development of a rich website targeted at smartphones. The key deliverables will be:

*Home Page*. a Home page that gives an overview of what the website does, what the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) is, and links to the other pages.

*Textual Display of Remote Data*. A page that lists information from a remote XML data file in a pleasant and easy to read format.  You should use jQuery to retrieve the file and jQuery to extract the information out of the data file and into the HTML document.

*Graphical Display of Remote Data*. A page or pages that graphically displays (charts) some of the key information in the data file.  You should use a chart appropriate for the data (typically line charts are used for time series and bar charts are more commonly used for singular comparisons of data).  This chart must be drawn using HTML5 graphics.

*Geographic Representation of Data* (using Google Maps Web Service). A page that displays a Google map of an area encompassing all countries in the data set provided with markers and info-windows located at the capital city of each country in the data set.  Use the Google Maps API to achieve this.

*Zipped Project*. A zipped file of the website to allow the instructor to fully test the code.

*Project Report*. A report describing your project.

==================
##Business Overview
==================

An important trend in modern business the more advanced use of data. This data is often available in XML or JSON formats to enable easy consumption of the data by websites.  This data can be consumed using rich clients using Javascript, HTML5, CSS and jQuery.
Specifications

You are to submit the deliverables listed in the overview to your instructor by the given due date.  The marking rubric gives a good indication of the deliverables expected.  You will be expected to use one of the following files.   It is the instructors choice as to which file your team will use but he/she will consider your preferences.  When you ask to use a file, please provide the instructor with 3 preferences so that it is easier for him to satisfy your requests.  It is not guaranteed that any of your preferences will be available.

The data files do not have the units used.  This is typically provided in a separate file.  You can determine which units are used by going to http://stats.oecd.org/, then going to the themes tab and choosing the right theme to find your information.  On the right hand side there will be a tab with the label Show Information.
